# File map for 13-Sep-2016 creation of analysis-kyle repo
# from the Yingkai\ \(Kyle\)\ Sha/ directory of the analysis repo.
# Done because the analysis repo had become so large
# that it hit Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-kyle repo:
#    cd geotraces
#    hg convert --filemap analysis/analysis-kyle_filemap.txt analysis analysis-kyle
